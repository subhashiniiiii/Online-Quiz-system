## Online Quiz System Documentation

---

### Chapter 1: Introduction

#### 1.1 Overview
The Online Quiz System is a web-based platform allowing users to participate in quizzes with a dynamic question bank, track their scores, analyze performance, and manage quiz content. This system offers a complete user experience with features for user registration, login, quiz participation, scoring, and detailed reporting.

#### 1.2 Objective
The system's primary goal is to provide an efficient and scalable way to handle quizzes, dynamically manage questions, and record user performance and progress. 

#### 1.3 Features
- **Dynamic Question Bank Management**: Admin users can manage quiz questions easily.
- **User Management**: Supports user registration, login, and profile management.
- **Quiz Participation and Scoring**: Users can take quizzes, receive scores, and view results.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Each user’s performance is logged and reported with accuracy.
- **Error Logging**: Centralized logging for quiz attempts, performance tracking, and error handling.
- **Testing**: Integration and unit tests for critical components using JUnit.

### Chapter 2: System Architecture

#### 2.1 Architectural Overview
The project follows a **Spring Boot MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture, providing a clean separation of concerns, modular design, and easy scalability.

#### 2.2 Components
- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and routes them to services. Controllers manage user requests and responses for user registration, login, quiz participation, and reporting.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic for user authentication, quiz participation, score calculation, and question management.
- **Repository Layer**: Manages data persistence with Spring Data JPA, handling CRUD operations for users, quizzes, attempts, and results.
- **Exception Layer**: Centralized exception handling for custom and global exceptions.
- **Entity Layer**: Maps Java classes to database tables to manage data representation.

#### 3.2 Explanation of Key Modules
- **Controller Module**: Manages HTTP endpoints.
- **Service Module**: Implements core business logic for the application.
- **Repository Module**: Interfaces for database CRUD operations.
- **Entity Module**: Data models representing tables for persistence.
- **Exception Module**: Defines custom exceptions for errors.

### Chapter 4: Controller Layer

#### 4.1 Overview
Controllers in the Online Quiz System handle incoming requests, convert them to specific service calls, and return responses in JSON format. Controllers include endpoints for user registration, login, quiz attempts, and reporting.

#### 4.2 Controller Classes
- **UserController**: Manages endpoints for user registration, login, and profile management.
- **QuizController**: Manages quiz-related operations, including quiz initiation, questions, and answers.
- **OnlineQuizSystemController**: Provides general controls for application health checks or other system-level functionalities.

Each method is annotated with Spring's `@RequestMapping` or related annotations (`@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`) to map specific HTTP requests to respective actions.

---

### Chapter 5: Service Layer

#### 5.1 Overview
The Service Layer performs business logic and is responsible for data manipulation before persisting or fetching from the repository.

#### 5.2 Service Classes
- **UserService**: Manages user-related business logic, including user registration, login, authentication, and validation.
- **QuizService**: Controls the quiz functionalities, such as starting a quiz, fetching questions, calculating scores, and handling user answers.
- **OnlineQuizSystemService**: Manages overall application functions and coordinates between services as required.

#### 5.3 Key Functions
- **User Authentication**: Checks user credentials and maintains session validity.
- **Question Management**: Provides a dynamic question bank for each quiz session.
- **Score Calculation**: Evaluates user answers and calculates quiz scores.
- **Performance Analysis**: Tracks and logs user performance data for reports.

---

### Chapter 6: Repository Layer

#### 6.1 Overview
The Repository Layer handles all interactions with the database using **Spring Data JPA**. Each entity has a corresponding repository interface that extends `JpaRepository`.

#### 6.2 Repository Interfaces
- **UserRepository**: Performs CRUD operations on user records.
- **QuizAttemptRepository**: Manages records for each quiz attempt.
- **UserAnswerRepository**: Tracks answers submitted by each user.
- **OnlineQuizSystemRepository**: Manages overall system settings or general data.

Each repository interface allows standard CRUD operations and custom queries when needed.

---

### Chapter 7: Entity Layer

#### 7.1 Overview
Entities represent the core data structure in the system and are mapped to database tables.

#### 7.2 Entity Classes
- **User**: Represents users with fields for username, password, email, etc.
- **QuizAttempt**: Stores each quiz attempt, linking users and score details.
- **UserAnswer**: Records each answer provided by users in a quiz.
- **OnlineQuizSystem**: Manages general settings or configuration data for the system.

Each entity class is annotated with `@Entity`, with `@Id` for primary keys, `@Column` for column mappings, and `@OneToMany` or `@ManyToOne` for relationships.

---

### Chapter 8: Exception Handling

#### 8.1 Overview
Custom exceptions in the system allow for detailed error handling, providing specific responses for known error types.

#### 8.2 Exception Classes
- **InvalidAnswerException**: Thrown when an invalid answer format or content is detected.
- **QuizNotFoundException**: Raised when a specified quiz is not found in the database.
- **AuthenticationFailedException**: Indicates failed login or registration due to invalid credentials.
- **GlobalExceptionHandler**: Catches and logs uncaught exceptions, providing generic error responses.

---

### Chapter 9: Logging and Error Handling

#### 9.1 Logging Framework
The system uses **Spring Boot’s built-in logging** (with SLF4J) for logging events, errors, and user activities. Logging is configured in `application.properties`.

#### 9.2 Error Handling
The **GlobalExceptionHandler** ensures that all exceptions are logged with relevant details, improving traceability for debugging.

---

### Chapter 10: Testing

#### 10.1 Overview
JUnit tests cover unit and integration testing for controllers, services, and repositories.

#### 10.2 Test Classes
- **Controller Tests**: Verifies HTTP endpoint responses.
- **Service Tests**: Validates business logic in service methods.
- **Integration Tests**: Tests end-to-end functionality.

---

### Chapter 11: Configuration and Deployment

#### 11.1 Application Properties
The `application.properties` file configures database connections, logging levels, and other environment-specific settings.

#### 11.2 Build and Run
- **Build Tool**: Maven is used for dependencies and project management.
- **Execution**: The application can be started with `mvn spring-boot:run`.
